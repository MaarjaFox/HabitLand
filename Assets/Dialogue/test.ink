Anyway, let's get to the point.. #speaker:Luna #portrait:catneutral
Good habits are crucial here...

Not only to get stronger but also to survive.

In the Dark Forest, there are terrifying creatures lurking...

To reach the forest, head east and follow the road. 

The deeper you go into the forest, the stronger they become.

We must clear out the forest from the curse that plagues it.

Good luck and let's meet there again!
